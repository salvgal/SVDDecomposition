# SVD Matrix Decomposition (Matrix Analysis for Statistics)

This is an implementation of an algorith that take as input two matrixes, return as output the matrix solution of the linear system, following the SVD decomposition algorithm.

It uses advanced libraries for large matrixes fast computation.
